    <b>Laboratory classes are based on course CSE-1103.</b>
	<br/>
	
	<p>The goal of this lab is to provide students with 
	  the skills needed to effectively design, develop, implement, debug, test, and maintain programs 
	  and more generally to solve problems using a computer.<br/> Students will be asked to solve various 
	  problems in a regular basis to increase their programming ability. Student should clearly 
	  understand the purpose of <b>header(.h) and source(.c)</b> files. Learn to writing Makefile and use of 
	  make for compilation and linking. The student will use both the integrated development 
	  environment(such as eclipse) and command line compilation to run programs. </p><br/>
